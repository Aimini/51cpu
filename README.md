This project are inspired by Ben Eater,he is a amazing man. you can watch his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU "Building an 8-bit breadboard computer!") or visit his [website](https://eater.net/8bit "Build an 8-bit computer | Ben Eater")  to learning build a breadboard 8 bit cpu.

You can find the instruction document from keil [website](http://www.keil.com/dd/docs/datashts/intel/ism51.pdf), but I prefer this [electronic version](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/doc0509.pdf), it's more clear.
